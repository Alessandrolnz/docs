# Connecting PagerDuty to Calmo

Calmo integrates with PagerDuty to help you manage incidents, investigate alerts, and run root cause analysis directly from your Slack workspace. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting your PagerDuty account to Calmo.

## Prerequisites

- A PagerDuty account with admin access
- A Calmo account

## Generating a PagerDuty API Token

To connect PagerDuty to Calmo, you'll need to generate a REST API key. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [PagerDuty account](https://app.pagerduty.com)
2. Navigate to **Configuration** â†’ **API Access**
3. Click the **Create New API Key** button
4. Provide a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Calmo Integration")
5. Select the appropriate role for the API key (Admin access is recommended for full functionality)
6. Click **Create Key**
7. Copy the generated API key immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

## Data Synced from PagerDuty to Calmo

When you connect PagerDuty to Calmo, the integration fetches the following data:

1. **Incidents** - Current and historical incident data including status, severity, and assignments
2. **Services** - Information about your monitored services and their configurations
3. **Escalation Policies** - Details about how incidents are escalated within your organization
4. **On-call Schedules** - Information about who is currently on-call and upcoming rotations
5. **Users** - User information for team members involved in incident response

This data enables Calmo to provide comprehensive incident management and analysis capabilities directly within your Slack workspace, without requiring you to switch contexts to the PagerDuty dashboard.

## Connecting PagerDuty to Calmo

The connection to PagerDuty is handled during the onboarding process. The Calmo team ensures that the integration is seamless and properly configured for your environment. No specific data preparation is needed, and the entire integration process typically takes only a few minutes to complete.
