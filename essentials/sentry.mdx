# Connecting Sentry to Calmo

Calmo integrates with Sentry to help you investigate issues and perform root cause analysis directly from your Slack workspace. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting your Sentry account to Calmo.

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry account with admin access
- A Calmo account

## Generating a Sentry Auth Token

To connect Sentry to Calmo, you'll need to generate an authentication token in Sentry. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Sentry account](https://sentry.io)
2. Navigate to **Settings** by clicking on your profile icon in the bottom left corner
3. Select **Auth Tokens** from the left sidebar under "Organization"
4. Click the **Create New Token** button
5. Provide a descriptive name for your token (e.g., "Calmo Integration")
6. Select the appropriate scopes for the token:
   - `project:read`
   - `event:read`
   - `org:read`
   - `member:read`
   - `team:read`
7. Click **Create Token**
8. Copy the generated token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

## Data Synced from Sentry to Calmo

When you connect Sentry to Calmo, the integration fetches the following data:

1. **Projects** - Information about all your Sentry projects, including project IDs, names, and configurations
2. **Issues** - Error issues from each project, including stack traces, error messages, and issue metadata
3. **Events** - Detailed event data from each project, providing granular information about each error occurrence
4. **Teams** - Team information from your organization, helping to associate issues with responsible teams
5. **Users** - User information from your organization, allowing for proper attribution and notification

This data enables Calmo to provide comprehensive error analysis and investigation capabilities directly within your Slack workspace, without requiring you to switch contexts to the Sentry dashboard.

## Connecting Sentry to Calmo

The connection to Sentry is handled during the onboarding process. The Calmo team ensures that the integration is seamless and properly configured for your environment. No specific data preparation is needed, and the entire integration process typically takes only a few minutes to complete.
