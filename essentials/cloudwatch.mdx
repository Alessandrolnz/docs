# Connecting CloudWatch to Calmo

Calmo integrates with AWS CloudWatch to help you monitor, investigate, and analyze your AWS application and infrastructure logs directly from your Slack workspace. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting your CloudWatch account to Calmo.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with CloudWatch access
- A Calmo account

## Setting Up AWS CloudWatch Access

To connect CloudWatch to Calmo, you'll need to set up the appropriate AWS credentials and permissions. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
2. Navigate to **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)
3. Create a new IAM user or use an existing one for Calmo integration
4. Attach the following policies to the user:
   - `CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess` - For reading CloudWatch logs
   - `CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess` - For reading CloudWatch metrics and alarms
5. Generate an access key and secret key for the IAM user
6. Make note of the following information:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - AWS Region Name (e.g., us-east-1)
   - Log Group Names you want to monitor

## Data Synced from CloudWatch to Calmo

When you connect CloudWatch to Calmo, the integration fetches the following data:

1. **Log Groups** - Information about your CloudWatch log groups

3. **Metrics** - Performance and operational metrics from your AWS resources
4. **Alarms** - Alert configurations and statuses for your monitored services
5. **Events** - System events and other significant occurrences

This data enables Calmo to provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis capabilities directly within your Slack workspace, without requiring you to switch contexts to the AWS CloudWatch dashboard.
