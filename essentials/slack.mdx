# Calmo for Slack

Integrate Calmo with your Slack workspace to transform how your team handles production incidents and alerts.

## Engineer-Level Debugging in Your Slack Channels

Calmo brings the expertise of a senior engineer directly into your Slack channels. When integrated with your Slack workspace, Calmo can:

- **Debug production issues** with the same approach and thoroughness as your best engineers
- **Automatically respond to alerts** in real-time as they occur
- **Provide comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** in less than 1 minute
- **Reduce alert fatigue** by handling routine investigations autonomously

## How It Works

1. **Connect Calmo to your Slack workspace** through our simple integration process
2. **Invite @Calmo** to relevant channels where you want monitoring and debugging support
3. **Receive instant analysis** when alerts trigger or when you mention @Calmo with an issue
4. **Get detailed RCA reports** complete with affected systems, timeline, and recommended actions

## Benefits

- **Immediate Response**: No more waiting for on-call engineers to investigate alerts
- **Consistent Analysis**: Every alert receives the same thorough investigation, regardless of time of day
- **Reduced MTTR**: With RCA delivered in under 60 seconds, your team can move directly to resolution
