4. Click the **+ New Key** button to create a new API key
5. Provide a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Calmo Integration")
6. Copy the generated API key immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
7. Next, navigate to **Application Keys** in the left sidebar
8. Click the **+ New Key** button to create a new Application key
9. Provide a descriptive name for your Application key (e.g., "Calmo Integration")
10. Copy the generated Application key immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

## Data Synced from Datadog to Calmo

1. **Metrics** - Performance and operational metrics from your infrastructure and applications

3. **Events** - System events, deployments, and other significant occurrences
4. **Dashboards** - Information about your custom dashboards and visualizations
5. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** - SLO configurations and current status

This data enables Calmo to provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis capabilities directly within your Slack workspace, without requiring you to switch contexts to the Datadog dashboard.
