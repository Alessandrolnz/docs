# Welcome to Calmo

## Cut Through the Noise

Modern observability creates more noise than signal. When incidents occur, engineers waste precious time jumping between dashboards, logs, and metrics to piece together what happened.

## Resolve Incidents Automatically

Calmo acts as your 24/7 on-call Software Engineer, automatically investigating incidents and delivering root cause analysisâ€”not just more dashboards.

- **Answers, Not Tools**: Get direct insights instead of raw data
- **10x Faster Resolution**: Automated investigation reduces MTTR
- **Engineering Focus**: Build features, not chase incidents
